**Paris Web, one of the biggest event to follow for webmakers, stood up from the 1st to the 3rd of october 2015.
On the program : 2 days of conferences about front-end, back-end, accessibility, quality and <abbr title="User eXperience">UX</abbr>.**

## Introduction

Paris Web, it's dozens of enriching conferences animated by passionate professionals. 
It is also the opportunity to meet people whom we follow on Twitter or blogs of which we read, in real-life.
It's like an annual health therapy. We stand out from these 2 days (or 3 if we make workshops) with the famous "Paris Web effect", a feeling to be back on board, 
full of good resolutions and with the desire to put into practice all that we learnt.
Paris Web is a unique atmosphere in which we mix our sharp jobs with a big dose of humour.
We see regularly people disguised as unicorn, slides with Care Bears and we get back with goodies which mix unicorns and rainbows!
Paris Web is the most accessible french web event thanks to stenotypy and <abbr title="French Sign Language">FSL</abbr> during conferences.
I had followed the previous editions in streaming and seen the program of this year, I didn't want to miss this one. It is done now and here is my report.

## Conferences of the first day

### Internet and freedom for the digital actors engagement

Adrienne Charmet, from the Quadrature du Net, explains that all laws are affecting freedom of digital.
We are the people who have the knowledge and skills to change the world of digital as it is becoming, to influence what is done.
The tone is set as several conferences will return to the processing of personal data.

### The front-end dev at Mach 1 daily

Christophe Porteneuve presented tools and methods to save time in our way to code (properly use its dev tools, tools like Webpack, Gulp, BrowserSync ...).

[See the video of The front-end dev at Mach 1 daily](https://vimeo.com/143169751 "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}


### The crypto for devs: small inventory of today's tools and techniques of tomorrow

Matthias Dugué, showed different methods to better secure user data including symmetric and asymmetric encryption. We saw a bit of history with [César code](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoire_de_la_cryptologie#Le_code_de_C.C3.A9sar "Setting the Caesar code on Wikipedia (new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, Enigma ... For me, rather front, this conference was really clear.

### "Hey, can you take this project? "

Sylvain Zyssman gave us the keys to resume a project in the middle of actors not always obvious to manage (carp, talkative, the hurry, the pessimist and the client).

### The "RUN" (or Application Management)

Leila Touati recalled the different types of maintenance that may take place on a site (preventive, adaptive, corrective, functional support and operation). All with a few film clips to illustrate his point.

The afternoon was under the sign of quality and performance.


### Webperf 2.0

With the arrival of HTTP2, we can drastically rethink how to optimize sites. Concatenation / minification will become useless, resources will be loaded in parallel rather than one after the other ...

[See video of the conference Webperf 2.0](https://vimeo.com/145318582 "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

### Creating a Culture of Quality Code

David West, Pinterest, presented various tools like Jenkins (formerly Hudson ) which is a continuous integration tool, Flow, Babel and unit testing tools like sinon.js or good practices such as CSS and JS lint. To him, quality is not a destination but a culture, an attitude and a constant concern.

### The Styleguide, well fed he keeps his promises

Laurent Guitton has a feedback on the site redesign Relais Châteaux speaking of the use of styleguides.
He said the Styleguide must be available full to the client. To which can be added to the documentation specific to the project, as a particular method of deployment or in which it may be recalled coding conventions.

### The challenge of a blind person: advisor on accessibility in an increasingly visual web

Conference hosted by Sylvie Duchateau.
She gave us a history of the tools (screen readers, Braille tablets) which before were only on Windows and paid. Today screen readers are available on all OS and are found for free (NVDA on Windows). She made the observation that some tools like Github, Gitlab have a 'fair' accessibility but as Dropbox and Google Drive are completely inaccessible. With the team of Access42, she created a referent accessibility training for blind and visually impaired to enable them to evaluate a website.

Objectives: "No longer be blind service which tests a site" but have real expertise to technically explain what to change and create new business for the disabled

Her cry of the heart which caused a burst of applause: "Accessibility for all: it is a right, a fight, a MUST! "

## The lectures of the second day

### Death and UX: Afterlife Digital and Digital Legacy

The day started on a sensitive subject but that affects us all: death. And especially what happens to our data when we die?
1 Facebook account on 30 belongs to a deceased person. 10,000 Facebook users die every day.
But what options do we have to anticipate the becoming of our data once we're gone?
Agnieszka Maria Walorska suggested a way forward through examples from her personal life.

### Towards a good practice Pair Design

Catherine Verfaillie described the little-known method in France. This is the same principle as the pair programming but for the DA, UX designer editors ... It is important to have a complementary pair. By the level of experience the profession or expertise that is different. The objective is the growing competence and awareness for a new approach. The arguments in favor of the application of this method are the improved quality, improved cooperation, it is approved by the developers and it helps to learn from other trades.

### CSP: content security policy

Nicolas Hoffmann presented CSP that secures the front part of a site declaring the resources allowed. By default, everything is not said is not allowed. It can block inline CSS styles, the onclick in javascript or ban domain names.

[See Video of CSP conference content security policy](https://vimeo.com/143169749 "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}


### SS6 by the code

We then were treated to a live coding session with Matthew Lux. He showed us the main novelties of SS6 such as adding the keyword "class", generators (functions which can be stopped en route and times with the next keyword), or arrow function. He showed us by example as the code becomes more readable by moving from ES5 to SS6.

### Vorlon.JS : a tool to simplify the web debug on all platforms

David Rousset and Etienne Margraff from Microsoft showed a lot of self-mockery and humor to an audience mainly with Mac Book and iPhone.
Vorlon.js is an open-source tool for comprehensive debugging. To install, simply go through NPM and call vorlon script in his page. It is extensible through plugins and is in the form of enhanced debug console. It connects to a device and see live which is a problem. We can highlighter elements like being in Firebug or Chrome Console. Is available also a Best Practices tab alert mistakes detrimental to accessibility, cleaner methods for its CSS code ...

### Pasdecalais.fr, history of an accessibility approach

Feedback from Bertrand Binois on pasdecalais.fr site's accessibility
This site is an example because it meets accessibility standards since many years.
In January 2010, the online site meets set at AA GRFA, which is what the French law requires. In March 2012 he spent at AA 3-star gold (98% gold cutlery criteria). In January 2014, the site was redesigned for the responsive. The site becomes pasdecalais.fr driver for version 3 of GRFA.
Today the site is labeled RGAA3 and also boasts a quality label issued by Opquast. It is recognized as a model at European level.
The site covers other criteria that are not part of GRFA guidelines but that covers a need of the users. Including proposing a "Dyslexia" button that displays a font adapted for easy reading of the site by dyslexic people. There are also buttons to change the text size (because all users do not necessarily know that they can do with their native browser).

### Self-Design: enhancing our identity and expertise on the web

This conference was one of the best of this edition. Moreover it is the only speaker to have enjoyed 2 rounds of applause before it even begins!
Marie Guillaumet prefers self-expression design to "Personal Branding" because we are not a brand or a product to sell.
She explained how we put forward without falling into the "Personal Branling" by sharing our knowledge, our expertise and our personal history.

### The day when we will not need accessibility

The dream of Olivier Nourry: Become useless. He hopes that one day it would happen through new forms of assistance to the disabled. Today there are several tools: screen readers, subtitles but they are too limited. Yet some stand out as Siri and VoiceOver TapTapSee, TranscriVox the Nao robot ... If these technologies continue to evolve to become more intelligent, perhaps that his dream will become reality.

### Conference surprise - the LSF interpreter in Paris Web: adaptive, responsive and agile

The conference was hosted by Sandrine Schwartz, LSF interpreter, who broke many ideas and has taught us many things in passing (including the sign of the cake in France means having rules in the United States and Moscow in Russian). She explained with great humor how his job is complicated during those 2 days he must sign words like skeuomorphism, Websockets ... But still, every year she comes back, driven by good humor and Indeed Paris Web
