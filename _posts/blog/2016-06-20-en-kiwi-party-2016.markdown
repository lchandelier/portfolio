## Introduction
On June 3, 2016, the Kiwi Party was held in Strasbourg. This is a free web conference for a day dedicated to the web quality, performance and accessibility.
12 conferences on a day that we followed with Julien Ramel. Here is our feedback on this day in Kiwiland!


### Our little daily stresses

The day started very well with Damien Sengner's conference who talked about stress in our trades.
He showed us the different types of existing stress (acute stress and chronic stress) as well as their phases (alarm, resistance and exhaustion).
The result is burnout or anxiety-depressive disorder. We must not believe that we are burnout because we don't know how to manage our time. It is a physical phenomenon.
To remedy this, we have to say no, to draw the alarm bell. Impose limits on tasks entrusted to us, deadlines or schedules given to us.
Changing projects regularly is a major stressor, it takes time to get back into it. Same for "5 minutes tasks". They do not exist. It takes time to open the project, get back in it, launch the necessary programs ...
Open space is also a vector of stress. It is important to be able to isolate yourself, for example by putting on headphones or by using a luminous device that changes color according to our availability.
It is also necessary to have a good lifestyle: less coffee and more sport for example.
Introduce pay transparency. The comparison between each employee will not last long because we all have a different profile that can justify differences.
Understanding his remuneration means being less stressed on his future because we see how we can evolve.
Leave independence to his employee so that he can innovate, reflect and flourish. Let him present his work to the client.
Do not retain information. Everyone must be able to access it without the need for human interaction.
Take breaks! We all have our rhythm.
The mirror argument is not one, telling an employee that in a competing business there is no such advantage is useless. He wants to flourish in his current structure and not in the competitor.
You have to allow yourself to air your schedule to be able to do technical watch.
Finally, drive away fear! If you aren't happy, do not hesitate to leave from your company or even become independent. It is essential to flourish and if you don't succeed, you have to talk around yourself (friends, doctor) because we worth better that it.

### 10 tricks about <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> that will save your life

Attended a more technical conference about SVG given by Vincent De Oliveira.
Vincent has given us different tricks such as using an optimization tool like, <abbr title="SVGO's Missing GUI">SVGOMG</abbr>, define a width and height as this is useful as long as the CSS is not served.
He doesn't recommend to use transformations because the origin of the transformation is different between the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and the SVG. It's better to use a javascript library for animations and transformations (<abbr title="GreenSock Animation Platform">GSAP</abbr> or SnapSVG for example).
SVG sprites work from IE9, if you do not use them yet, it's time to get started!

### Put some free in your projects

Pierre Rudloff explained why and how to make free.
We use it in a lot of our projects. Free has a lot of advantages. It allows not to reinvent the wheel, to use a code that has been audited, to enroll in an ecosystem. Bringing in your contribution helps you to show your skills, have feedback on your code and enjoy the improvements of others, while helping them.
The best practices are to make sure to read the licenses to be in good standing, to use package managers to have easier dependency management (NPM, Bower, ...). Do not hesitate to report a bug rather than correct it for yourself and not communicate on it. But before, one has to make sure that it hasn't already been reported and read the guidelines to write it correctly (and in English most of the time).
For a good bug report, several points must be taken into account:

 * Make sure it has not already been reported
 * Read the guidelines to make the report
 * Write in English (most of the time)
 * Detail the bug, if possible, a version of the library used, a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, a platform and the expected result. Do not just say "it doesn't work"

There may be a need to make a patch from a library. To do this, it's necessary to discuss it with the author and then take the latest version of the library and be careful to respect the code conventions of it.
It's possible to create a plugin if you do not find what you expect. For that it's necessary to :

 * Check that it doesn't already exist
 * Define features
 * Choose a license
 * Use semantic versioning (standard that defines how to name versions of a tool)
 * Document its code and installation of the plugin

Ideally, you should integrate free in your workflow. For that, it must be included in its budget and allow time for developers to contribute. A financial contribution for projects often used can be welcomed.
Finally, if you want to create free software here are some tips:

 * Post it on Git
 * Cut it into modules
 * Write documentation
 * Use a known code standard
 * Be inclusive by allowing easy installation for the uninitiated
 * Be sympathetic to users / contributors

### Agility for small projects

The web changes and becomes applications.
Tools such as Trello and Git allow to detail the project and tell its story. It's an exchange of experience.
For better agility, it's possible to use static site generators (Jekyll for example). With this kind of tool, you can easily put a prototype online, simple, before making the design. Thus, the iterations are quickly made between production and development.

### Integration and Webapps: ProTips

A concentrate of best practices was in M4D'z conference. He showed us the point to use as much as possible tags of zones (<code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>) or <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications"> ARIA</abbr> roles to skin a page rather than using CSS classes.
To avoid unnecessary specificity, you can use the [CSS Specificity](http://cssspecificity.com "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or [Specificity Calculator](http://specificity.keegan.st/ "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}
You can use <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> or a template engine like pug or nunjucks. It helps for reusing!
Above all, you may not use too long selectors (+ 4 levels of nesting) of identifiers or forced styles (!important)
You can use pre/postprocessors for the use of mixins, of nesting on the one hand and and compatibility on the other hand.
At last, for webapps, you can use a front-end framework like React or vue.js and a packer like Webpack or Rollup.

### Git ProTips

Christophe Porteneuve made a real one-man show to give us some Git commands. Everything is in the video below:

### HTTPS everywhere

In his presentation, Frederic Kayser taught us, among other things, that Google doesn't encrypt between its traffic between data centers and that the revelations of Edward Snowden had gained 7 years technically.
It also presented very useful tools to have an inventory of the security of our site / server with [Qualys](https://www.ssllabs.com/ "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or [acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

### Email in all its forms

An email is not just a question of code, this is what Sébastien Lejeune showed us in his presentation.
First of all, the from must take the name of the brand, have an alias as well as an identifiable email.
The subject must be 50 characters maximum, be related to the email. Don't hesitate to do A/B Testing and use pictos.
The pre-header must be 100 characters maximum. It summarizes the email's purpose and contains mirror page and unsubscribe links.
The footer contains an unsubscribe link, another link to account preferences and others to social networks.
For Call-to-Action, use HTML rather than an image. Buttons should be preferred to links.
The width of an email desktop must be between 500 and 640px. The header between 100 and 200px.
A desktop-specific image must be used. It must be simple, visual and related to the email. You can use a background pattern of the mail.
For the mobile, the ideal width is between 280 and 320px, on one column. Don't be afraid of scrolling. Thus, we can increase the spacing and the font of character (16px) for a good readability.
Call-to-action must be at least 44 × 44. The recommended text size on the buttons is 20px.
For integration, some tips:

 * Pay attention to the 102k limit on Gmail
 * Use media-queries
 * Initial-scale=1 width=device-width
 * A transitional doctype
 * Encoding in utf-8
 * Put styles on the <code><td></code>
 * Width to 100% on the main <table>
 * Pictures in x2
 * Alt on the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
 * Links in target="_blank"
	 
To test, Email on Acid or Litmus are very effective.

### Code rewiewztraminer: unlike wine, they are less good late

Morgane Hervé presented her feedback on code review within her team.
Why do code review?

 * Avoid bugs, the "bus factor"
 * Correct design errors
 * Improve Teamwork
 * Enable the rise of competence
 * Improve code quality

The 3 W Who, When What/How:

 * Who ? Everyone can do it, you have to be 2 at least.
 * When? Every day ideally, at least several times a week and between 2 developments of features.
The more it is made regularly, the simpler and easier it is to make.

 * What how ? Using Github, GitLab or Bitbucket. It can be done by several but not too many. You can assign it in turns to the team or target the right person for the right task.
Finally, it should focus on the functional aspect and logic rather than the coding standards.

How to convince a manager / project manager to set up the code review?

 * Money -> Better branding, deliveries are better
 * Insurance -> We know what we put into production
 * Improvement -> Sharing of best practices
 * Agnostic -> same process, no matter the techno used.

### Modern workflow looking for old-fashioned graphic designer

To have a good workflow between designer and integrator, Gaël Poupard proposed his method of organization.
We must begin to define a working protocol, to question ourselves. We can draw inspiration from the Photoshop Etiquette for design and from the book <span lang="fr">Intégration web : les bonnes pratiques pour le front</span>.
It may be useful to use Git to have a history of the models. At the <abbr title="Photoshop Document">PSD</abbr> level, you can apply the same logic as for the front, for example, include common parts in a single file (Header / footer) to be able to make one change on every pages. This helps to reflect the front organization to have.
Use Gulp to automate as many tasks as possible. This helps to generate sprites or icon font on the fly or even allow to optimize images. By installing it on your designer computer, it can make a deliverable already optimized for integration.
The designer can deliver a styleguide using <abbr title="Creative Cloud">CC</abbr> libraries or PSD.rb

The brakes that can occur are:

 * The designer doesn't want to leave his comfort zone and therefore, adopt new tools/methods
 * PSDs coming from elsewhere
 * The V-cycle
 * Too many people in projects that cause information to get lost
The success key is communication!

### CSS Selector Wars: a new hope?

To avoid conflicts between CSS selectors, Florens Vershelde offers the following solutions:

 * Have multiple levels of granularity using <abbr title="Block Element Modify">BEM</abbr>, utility classes or atomic classes
 * Use CSS Modules

### Visual identity on the web, thinking beyond print

Aurélien Sesmat explained how to have a good visual identity. For that it is necessary to:

 * Define the UX and technical part
 * Deal with the client's budget
 * Integrate prototype animations

Animations must be defined upstream between the UX and the <abbr title="Art Direction">AD</abbr>. A presentation of the technical elements will reassure the customer and frame the AD.
This makes it possible to avoid unnecessary feedback in the development phase, to specify how the visual identity articulates as well as the technical details to achieve it.
