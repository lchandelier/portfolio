My first project at Wax Interactive. I’ve really enjoyed working on it. 

La Praille is a huge mall based in Geneva.
The website has been refreshed graphically and technically, with a Drupal update.
There was no front-end constraints so I’ve used the front-end [starter kit](https://github.com/mchandelier/korat "Korat starter kit (new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} I started to build months ago and enhanced it.

The website is responsive and there is some flexbox technique and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> animations.


See [Praille’s website](http://la-praille.ch/ "Praille (new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
