One of the projects I love most because it made me discover the accessibility universe and turned it into a passion.
I worked on the front end part (<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>/<abbr title="Javascript">JS</abbr>) and Orange Business & Services team worked on the back-end and had the accessibility expertise.

I learned a lot with them and I was very proud to see this website was [Accessiweb labellised](http://www.accessiweb.org/index.php/rapport_de_labellisation/items/conseil-general-isere-cg38.html "Accessiweb labellisation page (new window)"){:target="_blank"}.

The website is no longer online in the version I worked on but you already can see it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150407125024/https://www.isere.fr/ "Isere website on the Internet Archive (new window)"){:target="_blank"}.
