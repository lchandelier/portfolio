I worked on the public, pros, press et Tour Operators websites front redesign (not responsive at the time). 
That was a very interesting project by its size and a good exercice of optimization. I had to reuse as much code as I could through all websites.
The websites are using jQuery and CSS with some sprites. I also participated in integrating content in the DotNetNuke CMS.
