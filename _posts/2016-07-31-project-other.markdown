I've worked on various websites (Private banking, Swiss States, Watchmaker,...). For confidentiality reasons, I'm not allowed to illustrate them.

These projects brought me to integrate my front-end code in .Net environments, meet accessibility standards for some of them. They are all responsive and built with Sass and jQuery.

I've used different techniques according to customer requests (sprites or icon fonts, Bootstrap or not).
