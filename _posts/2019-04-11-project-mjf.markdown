My first project with Vue.js framework, and what a project!
It's an experience to create our custom programme for the Montreux Jazz Festival 2019.

After answered 6 questions, our programme appear for all the festival. From there, we can buy ticket for the venues we want. It's also possible to restart the experience if we are not satisfied with the results.

For this project, I've been part of the [Superhuit](https://superhuit.ch/ "(new window)"){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} development team. I've brought an accessibility touch to this experience and done CSS and Vue.js development as well.
